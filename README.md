# RaunakKumarVerma-Deep-learning-GAN--based-Anomaly-Detection-in-machinery-for-resolving-class-imbalan
The Project aimed to give a gentle introduction on Anomaly Detection and Predictive maintenance followed by the solution used to solve the problem of imbalance data and to detect anomalies in industrial machines so that predictive maintenance could be performed. 
â€¢	The model was successfully able to complete anomaly detection using GAN on time series Industrial data using Orion API and TADGAN pipeline. The Model is the first step of using the very recently developed ORION library for Anomaly Detection in Machinery with imbalance Dataset. 
This Project could further be extended to other fields like Healthcare and Management

TO run the code, we need to install the orion library which could be done simply by 
--> pip install orion-ml 

after this we can use the code directly over any dataset provided.
